    "Although i am here in new york, Israel is experiencing a very intense week of elections. \n",
    "The country’s longtime prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is attached to a series of corruption scandals and facing a serious challenge from a new rival. Israel’s election is a free for all: Instead of two major parties, there’s a whopping total of 47 parties competing at the ballot box. More than a dozen parties could make the next Knesset.\n",

    "Growing up, in a relatively young country, I was brought up listening to the artists who were part of the foundation of the new local music scene. This scene was merging during the 60-70's right after the 6-day war and Yom Kippur war, both wars had a heavy casualty. Furthermore, a new establishment of an Israeli pop culture started to mimicked a lot of the western hippie/free love/peace scenes. At the time, pop culture, especially in Israel was very naive. people actually believed that peace was coming and there was a strong sentiment that these wars would be the last war.\n",
    "\n",
    "These songs went on beyond the pop culture origin of the '60-'70s and became ingrained in the national outlook and ceremonial culture. these songs were seen as prayers for peace, and were sung and recited in school classrooms, played on the radio, chanted at political protests and sung at national events.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most meaningful songs (to me at least) is \"I was born for peace\", written by Uzi Hitman. I grew up singing, performing and dancing to it. in my mind this song is a culmination of all the songs from this time in its explicit demand for peace. this song was nationally sponsered by the goverment to present to the eurovision (the european national song contest) to represent israel. \n",

    "During the past month, listening to politicians interviews, reading their statements and following their election campaigns, it stood out to me, and to my closest friends that the word Peace was never used. There were a couple of viral videos made by activists trying to provoke the discussion to move throward peace. \n",
    "This is a far cry from this political scene when I was growing up the discussion of peace and how to get there was a main focal point to politicians, especially since peace was achieved with two Israels past enemies (Jordan and Egypt).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of all of this, my first attempt at completing these assignments was I wanted to combine our national anthem with the song \"I was born to peace\", the result was partly interesting but didn't have any new/interesting contribution to the subject as I imagined. but led me to think of another option.\n",
    "\n",
    "My next thought was to transcribe lines from the song \"I was born for peace\" over the answers of the Israeli PM.\n",
    "while Searching for the latest interviews, I came upon Netanyahu latest AIPAC speech from a week ago.\n",
    "1 / I choose only the sentences that had the word Israel in them \n",
    "2 / I replaced the word Israel with peace.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that the code is relatively small and humble, but I felt like it was the right procedure for this text.\n",
    "the resulting piece is a bit disorienting as it is a far cry from anything you would hear in any political discussion by mainstream politicians today. Thinking back to the ideals I grew up on being told my generation would be the last to serve in the army and experience wars this text is almost dystopian and deeply saddening to read. one can definitely argue that the world is moving in a positive direction yet I am sad that the discussion isn't as hopeful and based \"naive\" ideals such as unconditional peace.
